2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance tanhlut/tanh_out_reg_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance wrom/rom_reg_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>
